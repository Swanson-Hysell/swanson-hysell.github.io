# Earth history research at Berkeley

The Swanson-Hysell Research Group seeks to place quantitative constraints on the long-term evolution of Earth through integrating geophysical and geochemical data sets that are developed within a rigorous geologic context. A major focus of our work is on paleomagnetic and rock magnetic data sets from stratigraphic sequences that our group develops in order to test hypotheses about the migrating positions of continents (paleogeography), changes to the surface environment (particularly planetary climate change), and the evolution of Earth‚Äôs magnetic field. Hypotheses abound in Earth science related to major transitions such as the reorganization of continental blocks into and out of supercontinents and the initiation and terminations of ice ages including global glaciation. Our research projects bring quantitative constraints to such changes, including their timing and rates, in order to test such hypotheses and further understanding of Earth‚Äôs long-term evolution.

The legendary Berkeley professor Andrew Lawson wrote in 1900 that: *‚ÄúIn the greater duration of time which they represent, in the greater complexity of the problems which they offer, and in their comparative nearness to the beginnings of geological history, pre-Cambrian rocks transcend in interest all the formations from the Cambrian to the present.‚Äù* Like Lawson, we are particularly fascinated by ancient Earth history with a focus on the Mesoproterozoic (1.6 billion to 1.0 billion years ago) and the Neoproterozoic (1.0 billion to 542 million years ago) Eras of Precambrian time when the Earth was going through profound change. The ability to apply modern analytical tools, in conjunction with original field observations, makes it an exceptionally exciting time to be working to understand global change through these critical intervals of Earth history.
